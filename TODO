There's something wrong with updating and rendering particles through the ParticleSystem2D.cpp class. Something is going on with the refferences. Try to fix that. 
Whenever I do the same Update() and Render() in Application class, it is successful, but as soon as I move it into another class, the functionality doesn't work.

- Rename the Draw in the ParticleSystem2D into Render() function.
- FIX THE ERROR WITH PARTICLES BEING STUCK
